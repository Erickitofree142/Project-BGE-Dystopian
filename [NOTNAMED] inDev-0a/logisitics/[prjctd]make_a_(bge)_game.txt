[Project Zero-Dynamic] Make A BGE (Basic Game Engine) Game
=================================================================

I named the Engine BGE for basic game engine, even the name is basic. The Engine can 
can make any 2d game. The Engine currently has mainly what a developing game needs. 
Some basic things to keep in mind is that the core engine files, gfx, inputs, and other
things shouldn't be changed, unless needed to, so it can do more things, which will
rarely happen. Other than that the game engine was made, so it can have many games. 

Step 1 Code All Entity, Tile and make All their art:

	Part A. |Create The Game|
	Create all the art required for the game like mobs, items, ui,
 	background, everything you want in the game, both in art and in
	code that. Save it all in its own package in the [com.core.games]
	pacakge example{com.core.games.pong}.

	Part B. |Load Up The Game|
	Make a File with the title of game, and extend it to the States class.
	Then Go to the Loader class[com.core.games.Handler] and add your game to 
	the hander so it can load the game (In the Future there will be a way to
	load up games using the button but for now if you want to run your game
	change the [18: currentGame = games[(game number)]). Then Go to the Assets
	class[com.core.gfx.Assets] and create all of your entiies and images. Also
	load up all the tiles of the game and give it a id number unique.


> The game Pong will be an example on how to create games. While Pong will not have
assets, maps, and other things, the point of doing it with pong it is to understand
the process of just adding your game. The whole loading up assets, and maps shouldn't
be too difficult, but it there will be a file for that stuff soon since the current
way of loading assets isn't the finilized version of it
