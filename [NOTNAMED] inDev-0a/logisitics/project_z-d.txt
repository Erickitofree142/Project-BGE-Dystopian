[Project Z-D]
Project Zero Dynamic Revised

	Random Project of using a game engine that can be use to run 
other games as well. Games can be basic or complex. Oh and forget about the naming, I didn't know what to name it. Goal is to make an engine that can create all sorts of games. This project was just named project dystopian, but the engine can be able to create or run other games. 

{Project Dystopian}
[Zero Day] Planned Things:

	[Idea] The rise of an unexpectected civilaztion leads a campaign of command
	and conquer, but their philosophies are only evil and harsh. The Dystopian
	area, Disctrict 4F-A, will be an area of humans controlled by robots and
	synthethic humans and another more unknown district to the player character in
	4F-A (1). Help people escape the tyranny using skills such as (fake) hacking to
	help lead a resistence movement (2). It seems to be able to work out, but
	humans that have left the dystopian region and are out in the forest still do 
	not get along (3).
  
		(1) The unknown district will be the second disctrict that Jeremy can 
		work on if you want to make a dystopian city, if not Erick will do it.
			{A} (Jeremy Put your Idea here)
		
			{B} Incase if Jeremy doesn't put anything or is not intrested
			in making a city. The city will be known as the 'City for the
			Barons' or A9-0. Player can visit it if he wants, and will
			notice how aliens and humans live together where in the 4F-A is 
			the opposite. They will live a life of luxury, and is also a 
			much larger region with large buildings. 

		(2) The story is only optional, if the player decides to keep the bunker
		to themselve they can. There will be several game endings and story
		quest or anything like that. The first Story, the liberation story, 
		where the player will either from the start begin this or if the player 
		dies in the wilderness, he will loose all his items, but not the 
		'player'. The player will just wake up again in a jail cell since the 
		enemy robot search team will just take him back to his captitvity where
		if the player does not escape he will get executed and the game will
		fully be finsished or basically Game Over. 

		(3) The player can eithter survive alone in the wilderness and finish a
		story and try to infintily live in the wilderness, or complete stories,
		missions, side quest, and more things.

	[At Game Start] The Player has a dream of the past of a what 
	can be called 'truamatizing' when he was in the military. The dream will be
	like a tutorial on controlls and can also set the setting on how the dystopian
	area just started. It will be 'truamatizing' to the players character because
	he doesn't get bacon? or something else. Point is find a reason to create a
	quick control tutorial. Player wakes up realizing that the dream was him 
	recalling the past, he doesn't tell no one though and lives like he never
	experienced the dream.

	[The Liberation Story by Erick]  The player then goes through life
	under the rule of a tyranical dystopian region. (1) After not being served 
	bacon, the player rebels. The player then finds a way to escape the area 
	using skills he obtain from the military (2). When he gets out in the 
	wilderness he finds several other people to, but they don't always get along
	with everyone they meet (3). There is also a team of robots/synths that are 
	out to capture these humans at the same time. The player finds an abandon
	military bunker the he lives in and soon begins expand and contruct an 
	underground bunker where he will lead a resistence againts them (4). 
		
		(1) Before the incedent of him not getting bacon or anything really 
		that would make sense on rebelling on the governemnt, it will show what 
		is life like there where everyone is a 'slave' because while they work
		for a living they are enclosed in a city where the person is forced to
		work always. The players Job is electronic repair or somthing fitting 	
		to the story.  

		(2) Since the player used to be in the military it will show how he
		knows how to handle weapons and stuff. 

		(3) There will be several factions that all have their own goals and 
		form of control. Like the [Raiders]? a loosley open, anarchy like group 
		who are all savages. Then there will be the [Hunters]? that aren't a 
		group but instead small groups of people the work together to survive, 	
		loot, kill anything they can.

		(4) Lead a resistance and get more people. The player can attack the 
		Dystopian region head on whenever they want. Although this is what will 
		end the story because when they do, the tyrnanical government only calls
		what can be called as 'heavy reinforcment' or anything that fits the
		name and finishes the resistance army fiishing in defeat no matter 	
		what. It can lost a long time if the player manages to escape, regrow
		the resistence, or has an army large enough to keep on going. The 
		player can also have the option of leaving the resistence if he wants 
		to do a different story or just wants to survive or even return to the 
		dystopian region using his hacking skills. If they do though the 
		liberation story goes on without the player. Another person (an Ai), 
		will lead the army.
