[Project Z-D]
Project Zero Dynamic Revised

	Random Project of using a game engine that can be use to run 
other games as well. Games can be basic or complex. Oh and forget about the naming, I didn't know what to name it. 

	The game was redone and revised to make it possible to create many games and even large 2d games(Not too big though). Currently the project is at developing the engine, but the current game put on is a test game so it can be changed.
